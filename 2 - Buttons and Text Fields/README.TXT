Assignment:
Create a program that allows users to enter the numerator and denominator of a fraction,
and when the user presses a button, the result is displayed in a Label (e.g. “1/2 = 0.5”).
Handle exceptions when the user doesn’t enter a number. Also react appropriately when
zero is entered for the denominator.
