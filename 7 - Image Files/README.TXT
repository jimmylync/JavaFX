Assignment:
Make the following improvements to the SimplePaint program:
  • Add a MenuBar that includes a File menu containing items New, Open, Save actions, as well
    as Quit and shortcut key combinations.
    (Remove the corresponding Buttons, as they are no longer needed.)
  • In a separate menu group, add an item that displays an informational alert window that
    credits you as the developer.
  • Create a set of colored buttons along the left edge of the screen that implement all 10 of the
    given fill colors. Your implementation should use the provided Color arrays from class and
    initialize them using a loop; minimize or remove redundant code.
