Assignment:
Create an application that could be used by a student taking the Discrete Structures course to
learn how a 4-bit binary number is converted to a decimal number. You will need to include a
short explanation of the process written for a student to understand. The central feature of the
application should be a row of 4 ComboBox controls that allow the user to choose the bits (0 or 1)
of a binary number; when the bits are changed, a corresponding decimal number display should
immediately be updated to the correct value.

As usual, the layout of the application, use of images, menus, etc., is up to you, but the application
should be as polished and professional-looking as you can make it.
