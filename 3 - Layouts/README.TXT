Assignment:
Design and implement a layout that contains exactly 19 buttons for a calculator app as follows.
 Do not code any functionality for the buttons at this time.

The digits: [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]

The operations/functions:
[plus] [minus] [times] [divides] [equals] [decimal point] [clear] [all clear] [delete]

Also include a TextField that spans across the top.

The buttons should not rearrange themselves when the window is resized.

Use Unicode characters for the minus, times, divides, and delete keys. (e.g. “\u00F7” will create
the traditional division symbol, preferable to a backslash).
