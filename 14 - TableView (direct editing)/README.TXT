Assignment:
Using the ShoppingList class as a starting point, add the following functionality:
  • A button “Add new item” which uses a series of Alert windows to get the item name, price, and
    quantity of a new item to add, creates the corresponding Item, and adds it to the ObservableList
  • A button “Calculate total cost” that will calculate the total price of the shopping list (sum of
    price * quantity for the list elements), and it will be displayed in a label on screen.
  • A menu item “Save to file” which prints out the shopping list and total price to a text file,
    chosen by a FileChooser object
